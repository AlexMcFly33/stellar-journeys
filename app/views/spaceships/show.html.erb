              <p>The Millennium Falcon is a fictional starship in
                the Star Wars franchise. Designed by Joe Johnston for the
                movie Star Wars (1977),[a] it has subsequently appeared in
                The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), The Empire Strikes Back
                (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), The Force Awakens (2015),
                The Last Jedi (2017), Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), and The
                Rise of Skywalker (2019). Additionally, the Falcon appears in
                a variety of Star Wars spin-off works, including books,
                comics, and games; James Luceno's novel Millennium Falcon
                focuses on the titular ship.[1] It also appears in the 2014
                animated film The Lego Movie in Lego form. The ship, a
                YT-1300 Corellian light freighter, is primarily commanded by
                smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford and Alden Ehrenreich) and his
                Wookiee first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo),
                and was previously owned by gambler/con-artist Lando Calrissian
                (Billy Dee Williams and Donald Glover). Solo: A Star Wars Story
                depicts the ship as being co-piloted by, and later integrated
                with, Calrissian's droid L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). Described
                as being one of the fastest vessels in the Star Wars canon, the
                Falcon looks worn-out but despite its humble origins and shabby
                exterior, the Millennium Falcon has played a critical role in
                some of the greatest victories of the Rebel Alliance and the New
                Republic.</p>
